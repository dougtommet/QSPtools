\title{Check the values of variables used as inputs into a created variable}
\usage{
checkvar(df, created_var, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The dataframe in which the new variable was created}

\item{created_var}{The name of the created varaiable}

\item{...}{The names of the component variables}
}
\value{
a data frame of summary values
}
\description{
This function creates a summary data frame showing each value of a created
variable, followed by each unique combinations of values of the component
varables used to create it. The frequency of each combination is reported.
}
\details{
The summary table is more useful if the created and component variables are
discrete and have few levels.

df <- tibble::tibble(a = c(rep(1, 10), rep(2, 10)),
                     b = c(rep(1, 5), rep(2, 10), rep(3, 5)))
df <- df \%>\%
  dplyr::mutate(new_var = a + b)
